# Spatial-filtering
# PROBLEM STATEMENT:

When veins are not visible, it is challenging to tell their health state, such as if they are blocked or broken, thus using angiography, we perform picture augmentation, segmentation, and smoothening to highlight the veins.

Spatial filtering plays a significant role in angiography, which is a medical imaging technique used to visualize blood vessels in the body, typically to diagnose and monitor conditions related to the circulatory system. Spatial filtering helps enhance the quality of angiographic images by reducing noise and improving vessel visibility.


 # PROPOSED SOLUTION:

1)IMAGE ENHANCEMENT: It is meant to enhance an angiography image using a high-pass filter.

2)SMOOTHENING: It is meant to reduce noise in a noisy image using Gaussian smoothing.

3)IMAGE SEGEMENTATION: It is designed for image processing and segmentation, with a focus on edge detection and creating a binary segmentation mask.
