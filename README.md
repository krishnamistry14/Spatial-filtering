# Spatial-filtering
PROBLEM STATEMENT:

When veins are not visible, it is challenging to tell their health state, such as if they are blocked or broken, thus using angiography, we perform picture augmentation, segmentation, and smoothening to highlight the veins.

Spatial filtering plays a significant role in angiography, which is a medical imaging technique used to visualize blood vessels in the body, typically to diagnose and monitor conditions related to the circulatory system. Spatial filtering helps enhance the quality of angiographic images by reducing noise and improving vessel visibility.
